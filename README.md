### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd global-holiday-calendar
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure API Workers**
   
   This application uses Cloudflare Workers to fetch real holiday data. You need to deploy the workers and configure the URLs:
   
   a. **Deploy the Cloudflare Workers:**
   - Deploy `src/workers/holidays.js` as a Cloudflare Worker
   - Deploy `src/workers/holiday-info.js` as a Cloudflare Worker
   - Make sure both workers are publicly accessible
   
   b. **Configure environment variables:**
   ```bash
   # Copy the example environment file
   cp .env.example .env
   
   # Edit .env and replace with your actual worker URLs
   REACT_APP_HOLIDAYS_WORKER_URL=https://your-holidays-worker.your-subdomain.workers.dev
   REACT_APP_HOLIDAY_INFO_WORKER_URL=https://your-holiday-info-worker.your-subdomain.workers.dev
   ```

4. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:5173` to view the application

### Build for Production
